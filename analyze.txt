1. How wide a variance is noticeable in the final year-end price of the stock for the 5 separate trials performed through steps IV and V? Analyze and draw your conclusions. 
2. Would the variance have been higher if Îµ was assigned purely on a random basis from an arbitrary distribution?

The variance for one of the run is 
"Variance list is"
30.70301
3.832749
22.90795
5.404438
130.4562

The variance is stock price depends on the random epsilon picked. Over multiple runs one run always show a close end price to start price but at least one of the run show quit a varied end price compared with start price.

As the epsilon is generated random it could be different for different run. However as obvious from above the prices in each run show a wide range of value and a high variance with respect to each other.
